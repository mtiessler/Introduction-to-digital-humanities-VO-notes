Here is a comprehensive summary of the lecture for a final exam.

**Part 1: Fundamentals of Quantum Computing**

**The Quantum World vs. The Classical World**

The foundational difference is that the quantum world is not deterministic; it is inherently stochastic. In classical physics, the state of a system determines its future. In quantum physics, we can only know the probability of a measurement's outcome. What happens before a measurement cannot be stated with certainty.

**Superposition**

A quantum system can exist in a combination of multiple states at the same time. This is called superposition. The famous thought experiment, SchrÃ¶dinger's Cat, illustrates this by proposing a cat in a box is in a superposition of being both dead and alive until the box is opened and a measurement is made.

**The Qubit**

The fundamental unit of quantum information is the quantum bit, or qubit. Unlike a classical bit that is either 0 or 1, a qubit is in a superposition of both states. It is represented as a combination of the states |0> and |1>. The squares of the amplitudes in this combination give the probability of measuring either |0> or |1>. Because the amplitudes are complex numbers, a qubit can be visualized as a point on the surface of a three-dimensional unit sphere called the Bloch Sphere. This means a single qubit can hold an infinite amount of information before it is measured.

**Quantum Parallelism and Quantum Registers**

When multiple qubits are combined into a quantum register, their power grows exponentially. A register with n qubits can exist in a superposition of all 2 to the power of n possible classical states at once. For example, a 300-qubit register could hold more values simultaneously than there are atoms in the known universe. When an operation is applied to this register, it is applied to all 2 to the power of n states at the same time. This is known as quantum parallelism.

**Entanglement**

Entanglement is a unique quantum phenomenon with no classical equivalent. Two or more qubits can become linked in such a way that their fates are intertwined, no matter how far apart they are. Measuring the state of one entangled qubit instantly influences the state of the other. Einstein called this "spooky action at a distance." Any quantum algorithm that provides an exponential speedup over a classical one must exploit entanglement.

**Principles of Quantum Algorithms**

A quantum algorithm is essentially a series of operations that manipulates the state of qubits. These operations are called unitary transformations, which are reversible, length-preserving maps. They are visualized using a quantum circuit diagram.

Most quantum algorithms today have a hybrid structure, involving both a classical computer (CPU) and a quantum processing unit (QPU). The process is:
1.  Classical Pre-Processing: A classical computer prepares the data.
2.  State Preparation: The classical data is encoded into a quantum state on the QPU.
3.  Algorithm Proper: The quantum circuit (the algorithm) is run on the QPU.
4.  Measurement: The state of the qubits is measured. This collapses the superposition into a classical state of 0s and 1s.
5.  Classical Post-Processing: Because measurement is probabilistic, the quantum computation is run many times (called "shots"). The resulting probability distribution is then analyzed on a classical computer to determine the final answer.

**Applications and The Cryptographic Threat**

Quantum computers can solve certain types of problems much more efficiently than classical computers.
- Factorization: Shor's algorithm can find the prime factors of large numbers in polynomial time, whereas the best known classical algorithms are exponential. This makes it a direct threat to current asymmetric cryptography like RSA.
- Unstructured Search: Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for searching an unstructured database. This weakens symmetric cryptography like AES, meaning key sizes must be doubled to maintain security.
- Quantum Machine Learning: By mapping data into the exponentially large quantum state space, problems can become easier to solve (e.g., linear separability in SVMs). The Quantum No-Free-Lunch theorem suggests that using entangled data can dramatically reduce the amount of training data needed.
- Other applications include optimization problems, molecule simulation for drug discovery, and solving systems of linear equations.

To counter the cryptographic threat, new standards known as Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) are being developed. These are algorithms, like Kyber and Dilithium, based on mathematical problems thought to be hard for both classical and quantum computers to solve.

**Part 2: From Quantum Computing to Quantum Humanities**

**Use Case: Vestimentary Communication and MUSE**

This section explores how quantum computing can be applied to a humanities problem: the analysis of clothing in film. Clothing is a form of non-verbal communication that conveys information about a character's personality, social status, and the story's context.

The MUSE project aims to extract a "costume language" from films. The core idea is that costumes are a system of signs with recurring patterns that costume designers use to solve recurring narrative problems. The MUSE approach involves:
1.  Defining a corpus of films (e.g., Westerns, High School Comedies).
2.  Creating a repository by meticulously cataloging every element of every costume based on a detailed taxonomy. This taxonomy includes base elements (e.g., shirt, pants), shapes, materials, colors, and more. The ontology has thousands of nodes.
3.  Analyzing this large dataset to identify recurring "costume patterns."
4.  A costume pattern is a documented, proven solution to a design problem, described by its Name, Icon (visual), Problem, Context, Solution (the combination of clothing items), References to other patterns, and Known Uses. For example, the "Male Outlaw" pattern in Westerns is typically solved with a combination of long pants, a shirt, a revolver, cowboy boots, and a specific hat.

**Quantum Humanities and the QHAna Tool**

The vision of Quantum Humanities is to use the power of quantum computers to solve new and existing research questions in the humanities, moving beyond the capabilities of current Digital Humanities methods.

The challenge is that humanities data is often categorical (e.g., 'red', 'shirt', 'Western') rather than numerical. To bridge this gap, the QHAna (Quantum Humanities Analysis Tool) was developed. QHAna is designed to let non-experts apply and compare classical and quantum analysis algorithms to humanities data.

A key part of the QHAna pipeline is data preparation. To handle categorical data, it uses the Wu-Palmer Similarity method. This calculates a numerical similarity score between two items in a taxonomy (like the MUSE clothing taxonomy) based on their distance from a common ancestor in the tree structure. This turns the categorical data into a numerical distance matrix.

This distance matrix can then be used as input for machine learning algorithms for tasks like clustering and classification. The QHAna tool allows researchers to run both classical and quantum versions of algorithms like k-Means and Support Vector Machines (SVM). In the case study, the quantum SVM, using a Quantum Kernel Estimation (QKE) approach, achieved a higher classification accuracy on the costume data than the classical SVM.

The overall goal of QHAna is to make quantum computing accessible for humanities research, support the analysis of its impact on different algorithms and data types, and provide a flexible, plugin-based tool for building custom analysis pipelines.
